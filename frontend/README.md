# E-commerce Web Application Frontend

This is the frontend part of the e-commerce web application built using the MERN stack. The frontend provides a user interface for customers to browse products, add them to the cart, and place orders.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm should be installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the frontend folder: `cd frontend`
3. Install frontend dependencies: `npm install`

## Available Scripts

In the frontend directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Usage

1. Start the frontend development server:
   - Navigate to the frontend folder: `cd frontend`
   - Run the development server: `npm start`

2. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.

The page will reload when you make changes, and you may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Testing

To launch the test runner for the frontend, use the following command in the frontend folder: `npm test`

## Build

To build the frontend app for production, use the following command in the frontend folder: `npm run build`

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
